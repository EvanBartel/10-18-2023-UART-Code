# Arduino UART Communication - Master and Slave

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to establish communication between two Arduino boards using UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) in a master-slave configuration. The master Arduino can send commands to control GPIO pins on the slave Arduino or send data to be printed on the slave's serial monitor.

## Components

- 2 Arduino boards (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Jumper wires
- Appropriate power source

## Wiring

Connect the two Arduino boards for UART communication using Software Serial:

- **Master Arduino:**
  - Pin 2 (TX) to Slave Arduino Pin 2 (RX)
  - Pin 3 (RX) to Slave Arduino Pin 3 (TX
